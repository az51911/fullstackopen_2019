Let's continue refactoring the application. Extract the following two components:

Button for defining the buttons used for submitting feedback
Statistic for displaying a single statistic, e.g. the average score.
To be clear: the Statistic component always displays a single statistic, meaning that the application uses multiple components for rendering all of the statistics:

const Statistics = (props) => {
  /// ...
  return(
    <div>
      <Statistic text="good" value ={...} />
      <Statistic text="neutral" value ={...} />
      <Statistic text="bad" value ={...} />
      // ...
    </div>
  )
}
The application's state should still be kept in the root App component.
